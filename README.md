# RC Revenge Pro BBLoader

A series of python scripts that allow you to load and decompress the `.BBK` files that are found within the Playstaton 2 game RC Revenge Pro.

## Usage

In a terminal, run the command with the python script:

```CMD
python BBLoad.py <Path to BB Folder> <Level #>
```

or

```CMD
python BBLoad.py <Path to BBK File>
```

A folder is created along side the folder or file that was used to load and all the necessary data is stored inside that folder. Not all data is currently extracted yet from the RAM dumps. But they can be explored around and dissected further if needed.
